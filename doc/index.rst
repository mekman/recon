Welcome to recon's documentation!
====================================

**Recon** is an open-source python module for (pRF-based) stimulus reconstruction
analyses from fMRI data. The main functions include:

- **simple reverse retinotopy** with the ``summation`` method *(Thirion et al. 2006; Kok & de Lange (2014); Ekman, Kok & de Lange (2017))*
- **advanced reverse retinotopy** with the ``multivariate`` method *(Ekman, Roelfsema & de Lange (in prep))*
- **spatio-temporal reconstruction** *(Ekman, Kok & de Lange (2017))*
- tuning-curve **forward model** *(Brouwer & Heeger (2009))* - *in future releases*

To see how to use it, please refer to the `README file
<https://github.com/mekman/recon/blob/master/README.md>`_ in the Github repository.
